Welcome to Madtast Plug PHP Framework.

You may add PHP pages to the pages folder,
You may add themes to the themes folder,

We would like to point out that you will find jquery, cycle and thickbox in this project,
we are not the creators of these frameworks/libraries and have nothing to do with their contents,
These components are simply used to enrich our framework.

In addition, we have included some images throughout this project, they are there for you to use with the project,
We do not take credit for creating the images. Most of this is simply sample data.


To start, please modify the config.inc.php file, you will want to change the root to the name of the folder of plug, if you
are using the root directory, you may leave it blank, you will also find many other options, they are worth a good look.
Also, there are options in certain files as well, so if you can't find something here, try looking in the corresponding file.


In the folder 'user/' in pages you will see a file called 'users.sql', this contains the SQL to create the users table,
you may use this as a reference or simply import it into your database.


The Photo Album found in pages in the 'images/' folder has the capability to allow 'admin users' to rename, add, and remove
Photo Albums, as well as upload photos to albums. In order to enable this, you must first enable and setup the login system.
Keep in mind, all Photo Albums are located in the 'media/albums/' folder.


Enjoy!
